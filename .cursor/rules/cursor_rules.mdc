description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules within this project's `.cursor/rules/` directory to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Refer to:** `[_meta_instructions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/_meta_instructions.mdc)` for the overall system structure.

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces/documents.
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/* # Use **/* for global rules.
  alwaysApply: boolean # True = always load, False = load only if glob matches.
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` format.
  - Example (Rule): `[dev_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc)`
  - Example (Code): `[scripts/dev.js](mdc:scripts/dev.js)`
  - Example (Memory Bank): `[activeContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/activeContext.md)`

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks.
  ```javascript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples relevant to this project.
  const goodExample = true;

  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns to avoid.
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with a high-level overview if complex.
  - Include specific, actionable requirements or information.
  - Show examples of correct implementation *from this project* if possible.
  - Keep rules DRY; reference other rules (`[rule_name.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule_name.mdc)`) or Memory Bank files instead of duplicating content.
  - Clearly state if a rule is prescriptive (a standard to follow) or descriptive (documenting a process/tool).

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Follow the process outlined in `[self_improve.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc)`.
  - Update rules when project patterns, tools, or workflows change.
  - Ensure examples remain accurate.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for readability.
  - Keep descriptions concise.
  - Include DO/DON'T examples where applicable.
  - Prioritize references to actual project code/files.
  - Maintain consistent formatting.
